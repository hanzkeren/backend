# Application Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user arrives at the application, they first see a landing page that briefly describes the service and prompts them to create an account. Below the headline, there is a button labeled "Get Started" which leads to the sign-up page. On the sign-up page, the user can choose to register with an email and password or select a social login option such as Google or GitHub. If they choose email registration, they enter their name, email address, and password, then submit the form. The system sends a confirmation email containing a link. When the user clicks this link, their email is verified and their account becomes active. If they register via social login, the application directs them to the provider’s authorization flow and, upon successful authentication, creates an account automatically. After registration, the user is redirected to the sign-in page where they enter their credentials. To recover a lost password, the user clicks the "Forgot Password" link on the sign-in page, enters their email address, and receives a password reset email. Using the link in that email, they choose a new password and then are redirected back to the sign-in page. At any time after signing in, the user can sign out via a button in the top navigation labeled "Logout," which ends the session and returns them to the landing page.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After signing in, the user lands on the main dashboard, which greets them with a header showing their name and a navigation menu along the left side. The dashboard view displays a summary of recent activity, such as recently updated records or pending tasks. Along the top, there is a search bar and an account icon that reveals a dropdown for Profile, Settings, and Logout. In the left navigation menu, the user sees links for Dashboard, User Management, Data Explorer, and API Documentation. Clicking on any of these links smoothly transitions the content area without reloading the entire page. The footer shows application version information and links to support resources. From this home page, the user can quickly jump to any core feature by selecting the appropriate section in the navigation menu.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

When the user selects User Management, the page displays a table of existing users, each row showing name, email, role, and status. At the top of this page is a button labeled "Add User" which opens a modal where the admin can enter new user details and assign roles. After submission, the modal closes and the new user appears in the list. Clicking on a user row opens an edit screen with form fields prefilled for name, email, role, and active state. The admin can make changes and save them, causing the page to refresh the row data and display a success message. In the Data Explorer section, the user sees a list of data models backed by the database. Clicking on a model name brings up a paginated view of records with options to view, edit, or delete each record. When editing a record, the user changes fields in an inline form and clicks "Save" to invoke the corresponding REST endpoint. If they click "Delete," a confirmation dialog appears. Confirming sends a delete request and the record is removed from the view. The API Documentation section shows an interactive portal generated from OpenAPI definitions. The user can expand each endpoint, view request parameters and response schemas, and try out calls directly in the browser. Behind the scenes, all these interactions use secure token-based authentication. If the user’s role does not allow a specific action, the button appears disabled and a tooltip explains the missing permission.

## Settings and Account Management

From the account icon in the header, the user navigates to Settings. The Settings page has tabs for Profile, Notifications, and Billing. Under Profile, the user updates their personal information and changes their password by entering the current and new passwords, then saving. Under Notifications, they toggle email or in-app alerts for events like new user registrations or system errors. If the application supports subscriptions, the Billing tab shows current plan details, payment method, and invoice history. The user can click a button labeled "Change Plan" to select a different subscription tier and confirm billing changes. After saving in any tab, the page displays a brief confirmation banner and remains on the same tab. A breadcrumb at the top allows the user to return to the Dashboard at any point.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

If the user submits invalid data in any form, the application highlights the erroneous field in red and shows a clear error message beneath it. For example, if the email format is incorrect during sign-up, the message reads "Please enter a valid email address." When the user loses internet connectivity, a banner appears at the top of the screen stating "Connection lost. Trying to reconnect..." and disables form submissions until connectivity returns. If an API call fails with a server error, the content area displays an error page that says "Something went wrong. Please try again later." and offers a button to retry the last action. If a non-admin user attempts to access an admin-only page by manipulating the URL, the system redirects them to an "Access Denied" page with an explanation and a link back to the Dashboard. In all error and alternate scenarios, the user is guided back to a normal flow either by retry options or clearly marked navigation links.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From their first visit to the landing page, the user signs up or logs in using email or social login and confirms their account via email. Once inside, they see the Dashboard summary and use the navigation menu to manage users, explore data, or read API documentation. Admins add and update users through modals and edit screens, while regular users view or update their own data. Users adjust personal settings and subscription details in the Settings area, and the application gracefully handles invalid inputs and connectivity issues with clear messages and retry options. Throughout, the interface remains consistent and intuitive, enabling users to accomplish key goals such as managing accounts, interacting with data, and integrating with the API without confusion.
